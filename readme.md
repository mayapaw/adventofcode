# 🎄 Advent of Code - My Cozy Coding Journey ✨

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! 💖 Here you'll find my adventures through the holiday coding challenges, wrapped up in all the wintery magic. Grab a warm drink, snuggle up with a plushie, and enjoy my solutions to these festive puzzles. ☕🐾✨

## What is Advent of Code? 📜
**[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)** is an annual set of fun and tricky programming challenges that run from **December 1st to December 25th**. Each day, a new coding puzzle unlocks, leading to a journey of algorithms, problem-solving, and sometimes a bit of holiday frustration (in the best way). 😅

## My Progress 🐾
I'll be posting my solutions here day-by-day (or, well, whenever I manage to solve them 🐱‍💻). My goal isn't always about finishing the fastest, but learning, experimenting, and having fun while I grow as a developer. Feel free to browse my solutions or suggest ideas!

| Day | Status        | Languages Used |
|-----|---------------|----------------|
| 1   | 🎁 Completed  | TypeScript     |
| 2   | 🎁 Completed  | TypeScript     |
| 3   | 🎁 Completed  | TypeScript     |


I'll try my best to complete as many as I can, but sometimes life (or naps with my plushies) takes priority. 💤


## Running the Solutions 🚀
- Each day has its own folder in the `src` directory, like `/day01/`, `/day02/`, etc.
- The scripts are written mainly in **TypeScript**.
- To run a solution:
  ```bash
  cd src/YYYY/dayXX
  bun part1.ts # or part2.ts
  ```

## 📂 Structure
Here's how everything is organized, nice and tidy! ✨

```
📦 AdventOfCode/ 
├── 📁 src/
│   ├── 📁 YYYY/ # The year of the challenge
│   │   ├── 📁 dayXX/ # The day of the challenge
│   │   │   ├── 📄 part1.ts # My solution for part 1 🧠
│   │   │   └── 📄 part2.ts # My solution for part 2 🧠
│   │   │   └── 📄 input.txt # Challenge input 📜

```

## Let's Connect! ✨
If you're also taking part in Advent of Code, I'd love to see your solutions or hear your thoughts! We could even team up for the tough days. 🎉 Feel free to reach out or leave an issue if you spot something cute (or broken) in my code. 🐾

## ✨ Features
- **Clean and modular code**: (Okay, most of the time 🙃)
- **Multiple languages**: Who doesn’t love a little variety? 🐾 (Mostly TypeScript though 💕)
- **Documented thought process**: So you can follow along with my brain noodles. 🧵💕

## A Little Note 🐱
This repo is my cozy little space for learning, experimenting, and having fun. Not every solution might be optimal, and some might be a bit silly, but they all represent my growth as a coder. I hope you find something helpful or inspiring here!

Thanks for visiting, and happy holidays! 🎁✨
