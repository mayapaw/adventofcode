## Day 1 Notes 📝

It was a very easy puzzle 🤔, but I ended up overthinking it. Instead of simply calculating the absolute difference 
between the two smallest numbers ➕➖, I started thinking about walking through the array values 🚶‍♀️ and somehow 
calculating the distance that way 📏.

I think i will try rewrite this to other language.
